title: "Audio System"
excerpt: "I used various analog signal processing skills to design, build, and test an audio system to the specifications of a client. The system was capable of cutting or boosting three individual frequency bands by 3.16 times. In addition, it displayed the signal strength of each individual frequency band to a display for the user. I also designed various subsystems for the audio system such as a graphic equalizer, class-d amplifier, and Arduino program high frequency PWM, and writing to a display.<br/><img src='/images/signal pic.jpg'>"
